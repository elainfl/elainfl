Hello everyone! My name is Elena and I am still a PhD Student in Biotechnology. I have recently found a great interest in Bioinformatics and in programming languages in general which made me realise about my interests in changing a bit my career. [GitHub repository](https://github.com/elainfl/elainfl). 

All sections have titles, which are listed in the site's navigation menu. At the top of each section, the section's title will render by default (e.g., Welcome to Jekyll!). If you want it to show something different (see Intro), add **auto-header: none** to your frontmatter, and add your text in a <h2> tag inside a <header> tag outside the frontmatter. You'll want to give each section an **order** parameter, also in the frontmatter, or it won't know where to put itself and will hide. Icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

You may notice that this section is written in Markdown -- either Markdown or html works!
