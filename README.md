# About me...

Since I began my journey through bioinformatics I discovered programming language and its unlimited potential to achieve anything you want. At first, I tried to manage with just the tools I needed but soon I felt the need to go beyond "the necessary". For this reason, I broaden my knowledge throughout the learning of different programming languages as well as libraries, packages and tools. In the same way as this personal Github, I am permanently in construction by means of learning new things. 

Do you have an idea? Are you looking for a partnership? Just contact me.
